An extension to the GPSG grammatical formalism is proposed, allowing non-terminals to consist of finite sequences of category labels, and allowing schematic variables to range over such sequences.	category labels	non-terminals	part_whole	{'e1': {'word': 'category labels', 'word_index': [(11, 12)], 'id': 'P83-1003.3'}, 'e2': {'word': 'non-terminals', 'word_index': [(7, 7)], 'id': 'P83-1003.2'}}	extension GPSG grammatical formalism proposed , allowing non-terminals consist finite sequences category labels , allowing schematic variables range sequences .
The extension is shown to be sufficient to provide a strongly adequate grammar for crossed serial dependencies, as found in e.g. Dutch subordinate clauses.	grammar	crossed serial dependencies	usage	{'e1': {'word': 'grammar', 'word_index': [(6, 6)], 'id': 'P83-1003.5'}, 'e2': {'word': 'crossed serial dependencies', 'word_index': [(7, 9)], 'id': 'P83-1003.6'}}	extension shown sufficient provide strongly adequate grammar crossed serial dependencies , found e.g. Dutch subordinate clauses .
The extension is shown to be parseable by a simple extension to an existing parsing method for GPSG.	parsing method	GPSG	usage	{'e1': {'word': 'parsing method', 'word_index': [(6, 7)], 'id': 'P83-1003.10'}, 'e2': {'word': 'GPSG', 'word_index': [(8, 8)], 'id': 'P83-1003.11'}}	extension shown parseable simple extension existing parsing method GPSG .

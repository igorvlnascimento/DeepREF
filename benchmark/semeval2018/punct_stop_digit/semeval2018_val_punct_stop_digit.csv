It also offers a reasonably automatic means to gather evidence on whether a more complex, context-sensitive model using the same general kind of linguistic information is likely to reward the effort that would be required to develop it: if clustering improves the performance of a model, this proves the existence of further context dependencies, not exploited by the unclustered model.	clustering	model	result	{'e1': {'word': 'clustering', 'word_index': [(26, 26)], 'id': 'A94-1010.16'}, 'e2': {'word': 'model', 'word_index': [(29, 29)], 'id': 'A94-1010.17'}}	also offers reasonably automatic means gather evidence whether complex , context - sensitive model using general kind linguistic information likely reward effort would required develop : clustering improves performance model , proves existence context dependencies , exploited unclustered model .

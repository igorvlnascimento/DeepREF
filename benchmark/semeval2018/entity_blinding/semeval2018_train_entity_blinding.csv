The structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the classification of new word senses in terms of the senses of words in the restricted vocabulary.	words	restricted vocabulary	part_whole	{'e1': {'word': 'words', 'word_index': [(24, 24)], 'id': 'J87-3001.11'}, 'e2': {'word': 'restricted vocabulary', 'word_index': [(27, 27)], 'id': 'J87-3001.12'}}	The structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the ENTITYUNRELATED of new ENTITYUNRELATED in terms of the ENTITYUNRELATED of ENTITY in the ENTITYOTHER .
This ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the definitions are produced when more complete analyses are not possible, resulting in a relatively robust analysis mechanism.	analysis mechanism	definitions	topic	{'e1': {'word': 'analysis mechanism', 'word_index': [(24, 24)], 'id': 'J87-3001.17'}, 'e2': {'word': 'definitions', 'word_index': [(8, 8)], 'id': 'J87-3001.16'}}	This ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the ENTITYOTHER are produced when more complete analyses are not possible , resulting in a relatively robust ENTITY .
Thus the work reported addresses two robustness problems faced by current experimental natural language processing systems: coping with an incomplete lexicon and with incomplete knowledge of phrasal constructions.	robustness problems	natural language processing systems	model-feature	{'e1': {'word': 'robustness problems', 'word_index': [(6, 6)], 'id': 'J87-3001.18'}, 'e2': {'word': 'natural language processing systems', 'word_index': [(11, 11)], 'id': 'J87-3001.19'}}	Thus the work reported addresses two ENTITY faced by current experimental ENTITYOTHER : coping with an incomplete ENTITYUNRELATED and with incomplete ENTITYUNRELATED of ENTITYUNRELATED .
This paper presents an evaluation method employing a latent variable model for paraphrases with their contexts.	latent variable model	evaluation method	usage	{'e1': {'word': 'latent variable model', 'word_index': [(7, 7)], 'id': 'I05-5009.2'}, 'e2': {'word': 'evaluation method', 'word_index': [(4, 4)], 'id': 'I05-5009.1'}}	This paper presents an ENTITYOTHER employing a ENTITY for ENTITYUNRELATED with their ENTITYUNRELATED .

We assume that the context of a sentence is indicated by a latent variable of the model as a topic and that the likelihood of each variable can be inferred.	context	sentence	model-feature	{'e1': {'word': 'context', 'word_index': [(4, 4)], 'id': 'I05-5009.5'}, 'e2': {'word': 'sentence', 'word_index': [(7, 7)], 'id': 'I05-5009.6'}}	We assume that the ENTITY of a ENTITYOTHER is indicated by a ENTITYUNRELATED of the ENTITYUNRELATED as a ENTITYUNRELATED and that the ENTITYUNRELATED of each ENTITYUNRELATED can be inferred .

A paraphrase is evaluated for whether its sentences are used in the same context.	sentences	context	model-feature	{'e1': {'word': 'sentences', 'word_index': [(7, 7)], 'id': 'I05-5009.13'}, 'e2': {'word': 'context', 'word_index': [(13, 13)], 'id': 'I05-5009.14'}}	A ENTITYUNRELATED is evaluated for whether its ENTITY are used in the same ENTITYOTHER .
The results also revealed an upper bound of accuracy of 77% with the method when using only topic information.	topic information	accuracy	result	{'e1': {'word': 'topic information', 'word_index': [(18, 18)], 'id': 'I05-5009.19'}, 'e2': {'word': 'accuracy', 'word_index': [(8, 8)], 'id': 'I05-5009.17'}}	The results also revealed an upper bound of ENTITYOTHER of 77 % with the ENTITYUNRELATED when using only ENTITY .
An extension to the GPSG grammatical formalism is proposed, allowing non-terminals to consist of finite sequences of category labels, and allowing schematic variables to range over such sequences.	category labels	non-terminals	part_whole	{'e1': {'word': 'category labels', 'word_index': [(16, 16)], 'id': 'P83-1003.3'}, 'e2': {'word': 'non-terminals', 'word_index': [(9, 9)], 'id': 'P83-1003.2'}}	An extension to the ENTITYUNRELATED is proposed , allowing ENTITYOTHER to consist of finite sequences of ENTITY , and allowing ENTITYUNRELATED to range over such sequences .
The extension is shown to be sufficient to provide a strongly adequate grammar for crossed serial dependencies, as found in e.g. Dutch subordinate clauses.	grammar	crossed serial dependencies	usage	{'e1': {'word': 'grammar', 'word_index': [(12, 12)], 'id': 'P83-1003.5'}, 'e2': {'word': 'crossed serial dependencies', 'word_index': [(14, 14)], 'id': 'P83-1003.6'}}	The extension is shown to be sufficient to provide a strongly adequate ENTITY for ENTITYOTHER , as found in e.g. ENTITYUNRELATED .
The extension is shown to be parseable by a simple extension to an existing parsing method for GPSG.	parsing method	GPSG	usage	{'e1': {'word': 'parsing method', 'word_index': [(14, 14)], 'id': 'P83-1003.10'}, 'e2': {'word': 'GPSG', 'word_index': [(16, 16)], 'id': 'P83-1003.11'}}	The extension is shown to be parseable by a simple extension to an existing ENTITY for ENTITYOTHER .

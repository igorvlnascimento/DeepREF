A paraphrase is evaluated for whether its sentences are used in the same context.	sentences	context	model-feature	{'e1': {'word': 'sentences', 'word_index': [(7, 7)], 'id': 'I05-5009.13'}, 'e2': {'word': 'context', 'word_index': [(13, 13)], 'id': 'I05-5009.14'}}	A ENTITYUNRELATED is evaluated for whether its ENTITY are used in the same ENTITYOTHER .
The results also revealed an upper bound of accuracy of 77% with the method when using only topic information.	topic information	accuracy	result	{'e1': {'word': 'topic information', 'word_index': [(18, 18)], 'id': 'I05-5009.19'}, 'e2': {'word': 'accuracy', 'word_index': [(8, 8)], 'id': 'I05-5009.17'}}	The results also revealed an upper bound of ENTITYOTHER of 77 % with the ENTITYUNRELATED when using only ENTITY .
An extension to the GPSG grammatical formalism is proposed, allowing non-terminals to consist of finite sequences of category labels, and allowing schematic variables to range over such sequences.	category labels	non-terminals	part_whole	{'e1': {'word': 'category labels', 'word_index': [(16, 16)], 'id': 'P83-1003.3'}, 'e2': {'word': 'non-terminals', 'word_index': [(9, 9)], 'id': 'P83-1003.2'}}	An extension to the ENTITYUNRELATED is proposed , allowing ENTITYOTHER to consist of finite sequences of ENTITY , and allowing ENTITYUNRELATED to range over such sequences .
The extension is shown to be sufficient to provide a strongly adequate grammar for crossed serial dependencies, as found in e.g. Dutch subordinate clauses.	grammar	crossed serial dependencies	usage	{'e1': {'word': 'grammar', 'word_index': [(12, 12)], 'id': 'P83-1003.5'}, 'e2': {'word': 'crossed serial dependencies', 'word_index': [(14, 14)], 'id': 'P83-1003.6'}}	The extension is shown to be sufficient to provide a strongly adequate ENTITY for ENTITYOTHER , as found in e.g. ENTITYUNRELATED .
The extension is shown to be parseable by a simple extension to an existing parsing method for GPSG.	parsing method	GPSG	usage	{'e1': {'word': 'parsing method', 'word_index': [(14, 14)], 'id': 'P83-1003.10'}, 'e2': {'word': 'GPSG', 'word_index': [(16, 16)], 'id': 'P83-1003.11'}}	The extension is shown to be parseable by a simple extension to an existing ENTITY for ENTITYOTHER .
